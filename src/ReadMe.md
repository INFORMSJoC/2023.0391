# Real-Time Rolling Stock and Timetable Rescheduling in Urban Rail Transit Systems

The software and data in this repository are a snapshot of the software and data
that were used in the research reported on in the paper "Real-Time Rolling Stock and Timetable Rescheduling in Urban Rail Transit Systems" by J. Yin, L. Yang, Z.Liang, et al.
## Description

This folder contains the source codes that are embedded into a software platform (based on .NET) for the simulation and optimization of trains in Beijing metro. Next, we briefly introduce the contents of the project, the main functions, key algrithms and the way of implementations. 

## Code structure 
Overall, the project involves three types of codes: 

* A software platform, involving the files Program.cs, Parameters.cs, Fangzhen.Designer.cs, etc, to load the input data, transform the data, visualize the train timetable, and output the results. In particular, here we define several classes (Line.cs, section.cs, station.cs, train.cs) as data structures and some other classes (Display.cs, etc) to display and adjust the train timetable in the software.
* Some key functions and algorithms to reschedule the train timetable. Basically, these functions are detaild in folder [Algorithm](src/WindowsFormsApplication7/Algorithm)
*

Note that: As most code comments and user guidance of the software are written in Chinese, please direct contact the developer Jiateng Yin (jtyin@bjtu.edu.cn) if you have any issues when running the project. Thanks!
